    <h2>Why Do I Want to Learn HTML?</h2>
    <p>
        I want to learn HTML because it is the foundation of every website. It helps
        create the structure of web pages, and without it, nothing can be displayed on a browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        Learning HTML allows me to understand how webpages are built. It is the first
        step before moving on to CSS and JavaScript, which add style and functionality.
    </p>
    <p>>
        HTML is essential for becoming a frontend developer, and mastering it will help me
        build my own projects and start my journey in web development.
